# readme2notion

`readme2notion` is a command-line tool that converts a Markdown file to Notion blocks and uploads them to a specified Notion page. It finds or creates a page with the specified name in the provided database.

## Features

- Converts Markdown files to Notion blocks.
- Uploads content to a Notion page.
- Finds or creates a page based on a database ID and page name.

## Example

```bash
REPOS_PATH=/path/to/repos
docker pull ghcr.io/oriolrius/readme2notion
docker run --rm \
  --network host \
  -v ${REPOS_PATH}:/repos \
  ghcr.io/oriolrius/readme2notion \
    --notionToken ${NOTION_API_TOKEN} \
    --commit ${LATEST_COMMIT} \
    /repos/README.md
```

This command reads `README.md` and uploads its content to a Notion page as specified in the configuration. 

Parameters:

- `--network host`: Uses the host network to access the Notion API, this is a trick for inherit the hostname.
- `-v ${REPOS_PATH}:/repos`: Mounts the repository the GIT repository.
- `--notionToken`: Notion API token.
- `--commit`: Git commit hash or tag.
- `/repos/README.md`: Path to the Markdown file to convert and upload.

**NOTE**: Images, attachments, and other non-text content are not supported.

## Configuration

The configuration file is automatically loaded from a file named `.notion.json` in the `/repos` directory or you can define the name and path using the parameter `--config` (`-c`). The configuration file should be in JSON format and include the following fields:

- `db_id`: The ID of the Notion database, where the page will be created/updated.
- `name`: The name of the Notion page. Final page name will be a combination of this name and the `hostname`: `hostname/name`.

### Example Configuration File (`.notionrc`)

```json
{
  "db_id": "acd90da1199d4b6181cdc0c3eb90fdd8",
  "name": "readme2notion"
}
```

## How It Works

1. **Command-line Parsing**: The tool uses `commander` to parse command-line options and arguments.
2. **Configuration Loading**: It loads configuration from a configuration file but it requires some additional parameters like `--notionToken` and `--commit`. This is because we don't want to store sensitive information in the repository.
3. **Markdown Conversion**: It reads the input Markdown file and converts it to Notion blocks using `@tryfabric/martian`.
4. **Notion Operations**: It uses the Notion API to find, create, or update the page. It finds a page by name in the specified database or creates a new one if it doesn't exist.
